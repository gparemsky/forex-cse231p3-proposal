# Objectives of this project:

Learn to handle scrubbing dirty input, do currency conversions using abstract units of measurments (pips and lot sizes)

This project mainly relies on the comprehension of loops, conditional statements, and fstrings. \
(There is a use of "eval" which may be innaproriate for this project, if so, lines 166 and 225 need to be re-thought out)

## Project breakdown

- ### Setting up the users account

![image](assets/initial_currency_input.gif)

On every run of the program, the user will be asked to input a currency, either USD or EUR, and an amount. \
This will represent how much money the user is working with and all calculation in the program will rely on it.\
The user also has the option to change their currency and amount on the fly with a menu option (option 3).
